<p>. ## 1MN.fig The named 1MN.fig is the NMSE versus Measurement ratio: M/N=0.2 to M/N=0.9 about the two methods. Here, we used the frist ten frames of the speech, and  the choosed speech is a clean speech of American English from the OSR Project, which is with a sampling rate at 8 KHz. ## 2SNR.fig The named 2SNR.fig is the NMSE versus input SNR (0-20dB), and the M/N=0.9.
