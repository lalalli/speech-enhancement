# The comparison of  the SBL-GAMP and EM-BG-GAMP 

This is a comparison about SBL-GAMP and EM-BG-GAMP for speech.

<p>
A computationally efficient sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm via the GAMP technique.
It has a lower computational complexity (see the paper in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7790383).

## 1MN.fig

1MN.fig is the NMSE versus Measurement ratio: M/N=0.2 to M/N=0.9 about the two methods. 
Here, we used the frist ten frames of the speech, and  the choosed speech is a clean speech of American English from the OSR Project, which is with a sampling rate at 8 KHz.
## 2SNR.fig 

The named 2SNR.fig is the NMSE versus input SNR (0-20dB), the M/N=0.9.the other is same as the 1MN.fig.
